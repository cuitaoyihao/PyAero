User Interface
==============

`PyAero <index.html>`_ comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) written in PYTHON and `PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_. The reason for using PyQt4 is that it works with Python 2.7.x., whereas PyQt5 needs Python 3.x. May be at a later point in time a migration to the more modern packages will be undertaken.
